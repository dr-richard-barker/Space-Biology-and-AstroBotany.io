Preliminary analysis reveals some NASA Data files produced by the GeneLab analysis team that should be easy to open, combine and visualise. 

**Simple challenges and short-term goals to help enable analysis** 

---

**Metadata summary**
Is there a simple way to sort and summarize the meta-data? 
I there a way to quantify the similarity of the accessions based on their metadata?

---

**Expression data**
Is there a simple way to plot the normalised counts as a heat map?
Is there a way to view the html files in the CoLab notebook?
Is there a way to view the differential expression data on Reactome pathways?
Is there a way to perform geneset enrichment analysis of differentially expressed loci. 
Is there a way to perform k-means and T-sne clustering to identify functionally related co-expression clusters.

**Early Goal:** Test website creation methods using this early introductory repo.
Space Biology and AstroBotany.io has the goal of making space biology data more FAIR.
