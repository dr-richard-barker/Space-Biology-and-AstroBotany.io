This Google CoLab notebook above pulls data from the GeneLab API.

Preliminary analysis reveals some NASA Data files produced by the GeneLab analysis team that should be easy to open, combine and visualise. 

**Simple challenges and short-term goals to help enable analysis**

**Metadata summary**

![GeneLab_gadgetIcon](https://dr-richard-barker.github.io/Space_Biology_and_AstroBotany.io/Images/GeneLab_gadgetIcon.png "NASA_GeneLab_Computer")

Is there a simple way to sort and summarize the meta-data? 

Is there a way to quantify the similarity of the accessions based on their metadata?

Is there a way to merge normalized counts for heatmaps?

Is there a way to merge counts for statistical analysis? 


---

**Expression data**

Is there a simple way to plot the normalised counts as a heat map?

Is there a way to view the html and other results files in the CoLab notebook?

Is there a way to view the differential expression data on Reactome pathways?

Is there a way to perform Geneset enrichment analysis of differentially expressed loci? 

Is there a way to perform PCA, K-means and T-SNE clustering to identify functionally related co-expression clusters?

This prototype figure uses data projected onto a KEGG pathway that was then customised using Adobe photoshop to aid with narrative development related to changes in membrane transport.
There are several issues with this artistic figure, primarily there isn't a color scale, showing that red is up and blue is down in gene expression. This highlights the use of "notebook-embedded" data visualisation. 


**Early Goal:** Test website creation methods using this early introductory repo.
Space Biology and AstroBotany.io has the goal of making space biology data more FAIR.
