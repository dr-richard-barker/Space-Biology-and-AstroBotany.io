Space biology is the study of how living organisms respond to the hazards of spaceflight. This includes animals, plants, and anything living that undergoes space travel. These hazards can be summarized by the following five factors:

Increased Radiation: Exposure to higher levels of radiation compared to Earth.
Altered Gravity: Gravity varies depending on location (ISS, Moon, Mars).
Hostile Environment: Confined and closed environments like capsules or habitats.
Long Distance from Earth: Feeling isolated due to vast distance and communication challenges.
Confinement in a Small Space: Contributing to stress and potentially affecting fitness and mood.
Health Consequences of Spaceflight Hazards

Each hazard is linked to specific potential health consequences. 

**Some examples include:**
Radiation: Increased cancer risk, vision changes, bone loss.
Altered Gravity: Similar health effects as radiation, plus cardiovascular issues, muscle atrophy.
Hostile Environment: Increased risk of infection, mood swings, sleep disruption.
Distance from Earth: Limited healthcare support, resources, and communication.
Confinement: Lowered fitness, potential for mood and sleep issues.
How We Study Space Biology


**Simulating space conditions:** Sending samples to space is expensive and difficult, so most studies are conducted on the ground. 
Centrifuges: Mimic altered gravity.
Particle Accelerators: Replicate radiation exposure.
Neutral Buoyancy Facilities/Bed Rest Studies: Simulate weightlessness.


**Ground-based studies can be combined with rarer spaceflight experiments on:**
Spacecraft
Space Station
High-Altitude Balloons
Suborbital Flights
Model Organisms


**Model organisms:** Space biology primarily uses model organisms instead of humans due to ethical and practical reasons. 
These organisms offer insights into human physiological systems and can be used to inform astronaut health:
Rodents
Fruit Flies
Plants
History of Space Biology


**History of space biology:** Space biology research has been ongoing for decades, with key advancements in different periods:
1960s: Early studies with the first animals in space (e.g., Sputnik dogs). Focus on understanding the effects of microgravity on basic biological processes.
1970s & 80s: Exploring cellular and physiological effects. The Space Shuttle provided larger platforms for experimentation.
1990s-Present: Advancements in technologies like molecular biology and genomics. The International Space Station (ISS) allows for diverse space biology experiments using advanced technologies. International collaboration is a key aspect of space biology research.
Earth Applications of Space Biology Research

Space biology research not only benefits space travel but also contributes to advancements here on Earth. 

**Examples include:**
Medical innovations related to bone density, muscle, and immune system health.
Improved understanding of cell behaviour and disease mechanisms.
Using space as a model to accelerate the study of diseases.
Development of biomedical devices and wearables.
Environmental monitoring innovations using satellites.
Agricultural technology advancements (e.g., hydroponics, aeroponics) for resource-limited environments.
Data Access for This Course

We will primarily access data from the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) for our space biology studies.  

**OSDR combines data from various NASA projects:**
Genelab: Stores molecular omics data related to spaceflight.
Astrobiology Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSA): Focuses on higher-order phenotypic data (physiology, bioimaging, etc.).
NASA Space Biology Biosample Sharing Program (BSP): Collects biosamples from spaceflight experiments and associated ground investigations.
NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection (NBIS): Repository of biospecimen samples not yet converted to data (available upon request).

**Searching for Data in OSDR**
OSDR offers various search filters due to the vast amount of data it contains. 

**Here are some examples:**
Data Type (study, experiment, biosample, etc.)
Organism (rodents, human cells, plants, etc.)
Tissue Type (roots, shoots, eye, skin,etc.)
Factor (radiation exposure, time course, etc.)
A Tour of the NASA Open Science Data Repository

The course will include a tour of OSDR, demonstrating how to find and access relevant data.

Challenges in Space Biology Research and How Machine Learning Can Help

**Small n Problem:** Limited sample sizes due to the difficulty and cost of spaceflight experiments.
High-Dimensional Data: Biological data, especially high-throughput sequencing data (genomics, transcriptomics), can be very complex. These datasets have many features (measurements) but few samples. This complexity makes it challenging to model biological systems and their interactions in space.
Heterogeneous Data Types: Valuable space biology data sets often include various data types (multimodal data) collected from the same experiment (e.g., transcriptomics, bioimaging, treatment variables, environmental telemetry). Combining and interpreting all this data can be challenging.
Translational Research: Findings from model organisms need to be relevant to humans for astronaut health applications.
Machine Learning Applications in Space Biology

Machine learning offers solutions to address some of these challenges and has various potential applications in space biology research. 

**Here are a few key areas:**

**Biological Analysis and Research:**
Combining and analyzing diverse data sets.
Amplifying biological signals and learning from them.
Knowledge discovery and hypothesis generation for designing new experiments.

**Data Management and Organization:**
Automating data management and structuring data for transfer and analysis.
Implementing AI-powered metadata organization and management for consistent data organization.

**Automation:**
Automating experimental payloads on flights.
Enabling in-situ analysis of data onboard spacecraft or habitats.

**Looking Ahead**
This repo will reflect learning from the OSDR AI/ML training course.
This will help us delve deeper into these applications of machine learning in space biology research.
